A Basic Tetris Game

Written in JavaScript following a tutorial by Ania Kubow.

This game was written during the COVID-19 lock down after having completed the Intermediate JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp. I found it a fantastic tutorial to follow on from that course because, whilst the FCC challenges are as brilliant as they are, we don't actually get to build a complete application with DOM manipulation.

I hadn't actually realised that it was possible to create something like this using JavaScript, so it was a real eye opener.

Thank you very much Ania, your hard work and effort is greatly appreciated.

Happy coding!

NB: This is not mobile friendly at the moment. With a prior background in 3D modeling and animation, we're just going through the process of learning Blender, with the intention of creating an awesome interface for the game. We'll then launch the multi-device compatible app.

Instructions:

Use Left Up Right and Down arrow keys on your keboard!
