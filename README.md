A Basic Tetris Game

Written in JavaScript following a tutorial by Ania Kubow.

This game was written during the COVID-19 lock down after having completed the Intermediate JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp. I found it a fantastic tutorial to follow on from that course because, whilst the FCC challenges are as brilliant as they are, we don't actually get to build a complete application with DOM manipulation.

I hadn't actually realised that it was possible to create something like this using JAvaScript, so it was a real eye opener.

Thank you very much Ania, your hard work and effort is greatly appreciated.

Happy coding!
